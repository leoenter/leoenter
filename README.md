 👋 Hi, I’m @leoenter, I’m currently learning frontend developer. I have been trying to be a web developer for couples of years, but the journey has been slow due im not a quick learner. 
 I need to start building projects thats why im here.  Today (8/7/2021)i finished my first project from frontendmentor, it is a simple card, and one of the requirements is to upload it here first.
 I don't know how to upload it...once i finished writting this i will read the hello world guide. I started learning programming old,but i know a lot of people started old and made it. That's it.
 I hope to meet you !.
